## How It Works

1. **Location Detection**: Upon loading the app, it prompts the user to allow location access. Once granted, the app retrieves the user's current coordinates.
2. **Fetching Weather Data**: The app uses the retrieved coordinates to make an API call to the weather service and fetches the relevant weather data.
3. **Display Weather**: The fetched weather data, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions, is displayed on the screen.
